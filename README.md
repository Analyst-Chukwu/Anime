**The Rise of Anime and the Power of Clean Data**

Anime has evolved from being a niche form of entertainment in Japan to a **global cultural phenomenon**, with an estimated **150-200 million fans worldwide**. From the streets of Tokyo to the bustling cities of New York, Paris, and São Paulo, anime has captivated audiences of all ages. Platforms like Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Bilibili report staggering numbers, showing just how deeply anime has embedded itself in mainstream media consumption.

But how do we quantify anime’s worldwide acceptance? How do we determine which anime truly resonates across different cultures? The answer lies in **data**—but not just any data. **Clean, structured, and meaningful data.**

### **A Dirty Dataset**
While anime’s popularity is undisputed, analyzing its reach and acceptance is often hindered by **dirty data**—incomplete, inconsistent, and unstructured datasets. This is where my expertise as a data analyst comes into play.

A massive dataset from **Kaggle** was obtained, but it was far from usable. The dataset was riddled with **missing values, duplicate entries, inconsistent naming conventions, and unstructured formats**. Many columns lacked proper standardization, and the most crucial piece of information—**worldwide popularity metrics**—was fragmented and buried under layers of unprocessed data.

### **The Data Cleaning Process**
To transform this dataset into an asset for anime enthusiasts, the following data-cleaning techniques were meticulously applied:

1. **Handling Missing Values:** Missing popularity scores and rankings were filled using median imputation, ensuring fairness across genres.
2. **Deduplication & Standardization:** Duplicate anime entries were identified and merged, while inconsistent name formats were standardized.
3. **Outlier Detection:** Unrealistic ratings or popularity scores were flagged and adjusted.
4. **Data Transformation & Normalization:** Numerical values were normalized to bring consistency to rating scales across different sources.

### **The Power of Clean Data for Anime Fans**
With a **cleaned and structured dataset**, anime lovers and analysts can now:
- **Watch Anime based on popularity trend**—Which anime is more popular?
- **Compare acceptance accross demographic**—Which Anime is loved by young girls, boys, older men, women?
- **Make data-driven recommendations**—Using ML models to predict anime preferences.

### **The Skills That Stand Me Out as a Dirty Data Analyst**
Cleaning this dataset wasn’t just a task—it was a showcase of **expert data wrangling skills**. Deploying data cleaning skills in  **SQL**, I transformed chaos into clarity.

This project highlights my expertise in:
- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling** (because raw data is never perfect!)
- **Data Storytelling** (turning numbers into narratives)
- **ETL Processes** (Extract, Transform, Load)
- **Machine Learning Readiness** (preparing data for advanced analytics)

### **Final Thoughts**
Anime is more than entertainment—it’s a data-driven ecosystem of cultural influence. By taking a **dirty Kaggle dataset** and transforming it into a **powerful analytical tool**, I’ve not only provided anime fans with insights but also demonstrated my ability to navigate the complexities of unstructured data.

In the world of data analytics, anyone can analyze clean data—but only the best can **master the art of cleaning dirty data**. And that’s exactly what I do.

Because I don’t just analyze data—I **refine it, structure it, and turn it into actionable insights.**
